# Coding_Quiz

* In this assignment we were tasked with creating a responsive multiple choice quiz using Javascript.

* Starting with an HTLM doc I set up different divs and sections to display a start button and description before
the quiz began.

* Once the quiz is started the user is presented with a multiple choice question that, if answered by clicking on the elements, moves on to the next question.

* On a correct answer the timer will stay counting down by 1, while if an incorrect answer is entered the timer is reduced by 4 seconds.

* Once the quiz is over a score is displayed that represents the time left multiplied by the percentage of questions the user answered correctly.

* The user is then to be prompted with a form to enter their initials and using local storage the highscores are set in a table.
